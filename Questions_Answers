## ❓ Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the difference between `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`?
**Answer:**

getElementById selects a single element by its id.  
getElementsByClassName selects all elements with a class and returns a live collection.  
querySelector returns the first element that matches a CSS selector.  
querySelectorAll returns all elements matching a CSS selector as a nodelist.

let newElement = document.createElement('p');
newElement.innerText = "change the text"
body.appendChild(newElement);

### 3. What is Event Bubbling? And how does it work?

If I click a button, first the button’s event works.
Then the event goes to its parent element.
After that, it goes to the parent’s parent, and it continues like this up to the body and html.


### 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Event Delegation in JavaScript means we do not need to add an event listener to every button or item. We just add one event listener on the parent, and it can handle all child events.

### 5. What is the difference between `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` methods?

preventDefault() --> stops the browser’s default action.

stopPropagation() --> stops the event from moving to parent elements.
